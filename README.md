# CS-300---Analysis-And-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  Creating a program that loaded a file, read and sorted it based on the chosen data structure, then displayed the results.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by doing a runtime analysis by using the Big O method and break down the algorithm from my pseudocode to determine what data structure had   the fastest approach. I can see why data structures are so important in larger programs, especially as more complexity gets involved. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I reviewed my notes from previous classes, as well as this one, on appropriate functions in the standard library that can help me create the needed code, such as     using .split to create tokens. Most of the material I needed was provided to me in this class to make the right decisions.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I will more closely pay attention and be mindful of how every line of code can begin to bloat software and how the improper utilization of data structures can slow   runtime.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This feels like the same as the previous question, but it helped reinforce the ideas that were established in previous courses about writing code that practices       industry standard, such as commenting function and intent.
